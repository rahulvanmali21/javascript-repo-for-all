# Introduction

This repository contains utility functions, polyfills, data structures, and algorithms written in JavaScript that can be useful in various web development projects. These are commonly used functions and algorithms that can help make web development easier and more efficient.

## Installation
You can clone this repository by using the following command:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

##Usage

### Util functions
The util functions are a collection of commonly used helper functions that can be used across different projects. These include functions for handling arrays, strings, and objects, among others.

### Polyfills
The polyfills included in this repository are functions that can be used to add missing functionality to older browsers that do not support certain features in modern JavaScript. These polyfills cover functions such as Array.prototype.forEach and String.prototype.startsWith.

### Data Structures
The data structures included in this repository are implementations of commonly used data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees. These data structures can be used in various algorithms to improve their efficiency.

### Algorithms
The algorithms included in this repository are implementations of commonly used algorithms such as sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort), searching algorithms (linear search, binary search), and graph traversal algorithms (depth-first search, breadth-first search).

### Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have any suggestions for new features or improvements, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
